					<h4>* Plan B: Murchison Falls National Park</h4>
					<p>* Go to the <a href="price.html">price</a> page to know more information about the price.</p>
					<p><strong>SIZE:</strong> 3840 sq km</p>
					<p><strong>LOCATION:</strong> In the northwest, approximately 90km from Masindi Uganda’s largest national park protects a chunk of untamed African savannah bisected by the mighty river Nile.</p>
					<p>It is named for the dramatic Murchison Falls, where the world’s longest river explodes violently through a narrow cleft in the Rift Valley escarpment to plunge into a frothing pool 43m below. Wildlife populations have largely recovered from the poaching of the 1980s; in the lush borassus grassland to the north of the Nile, elephant, buffalo, giraffe and a variety of antelope are regularly encountered on game drives, while lion are seen with increasing frequency.</p>
					<p>In the southeast, Rabongo Forest is home to chimps and other rainforest creatures.</p>
					<p>The Nile itself hosts one of Africa’s densest hippo and crocodile populations, and a dazzling variety of waterbirds including the world’s most accessible wild population of the rare shoebill stork.</p>
					<p><strong>WHAT TO DO:</strong></p>
					<p>Regular launch trips to the base of the falls offer fine game-viewing  and birdwatching. Boat trips to the Lake Albert delta provide the best chance in Africa of sighting shoebills.</p>
					<p>Chimp tracking at Rabongo Forest, and en route from Masindi in the Budongo Forest. Game drives on a good network of roads.s</p>

					<h4>* Plan C: Mgahinga Gorilla National Park</h4>
					<p>* Go to the <a href="price.html">price</a> page to know more information about the price.</p>
					<p><strong>SIZE:</strong> 33 sq km</p>
					<p><strong>LOCATION:</strong> Far southwest, bordering Rwanda and Congo, 14km from Kisoro town.</p>
					<p>The Park covers the northern slopes of the three northernmost Virunga Volcanoes: Mt. Muhavura (4,127 m), Mt. Gahinga (3,474 m), and Mt. Sabinyo (3,645 m). From far away, the huge cones of the virunga volcanoes dominate the landscape and beckon you as you approach. When you reach the park you can get a great overview of the area by walking up the viewpoint, just 15 minutes from Ntebeko Gate. Mgahinga Park has great biological importance because throughout the climatic changes of the Pleistocene ice ages, mountains such as these provided a refuge for mountain plants and animals, which moved up or down the slopes as climate became warmer or cooler. The Virungas are home to a large variety of wildlife, including about half the world’s critically endangered mountain gorillas.</p>
					<p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>
					<p><strong>* Gorilla Tracking</strong></p>
					<p>This is the most thrilling tourist activity in Mgahinga Gorilla National Park. The habituated gorilla in this park is called the Nyakagezi, which consists of 9 members, 2 silverbacks, 3 adult females, 2 juveniles and 2 infants.</p>
					<p>Gorilla Tracking can be strenuous walk, so go prepared. It is advisable that you:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Wear shoes with good traction, suitable for steep muddy slopes</li>
						<li>Carry rain gear, sunscreen and a hut, as the weather is unpredictable.</li>
						<li>Carry water and food</li>
						<li>Carry binoculars, you will see much more, you can hire from the park office</li>
						<li>When taking photos, remember your subjects are black animals in dim light, and flash is not allowed.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Good Manners for Gorilla Watchers:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Keep your voice down or be quiet. You will see and hear if you do.</li>
						<li>Don’t point or waive your arms- this can be seen as a threat. Move slowly.</li>
						<li>If approached by a gorilla, back away slowly to keep 5m separation.</li>
						<li>Don’t use flash, this could threaten the gorillas and bother other visitors.</li>
					</ul>
					<p><strong>* Hiking:</strong> Volcano Climbing</p>
					<p><strong>Mt. Gahinga (3474m):</strong> On your way to the park, look out for small piles of stones in the garden fields. The local people call such a pile a ‘Gahinga’.</p>
					<p><strong>Mt. Sabyinyo (366m):</strong> Like an old man, time has eroded Mt. Sabyinyo’s crown.</p>
					<p><strong>Mt. Muhavura (4127m):</strong> Seen from all over Kisoro, this volcano acts as a guide. The typical cone-shaped Mountain provides some of the best views in the country. </p>
					<p><strong>* Cave Exploration: Garama cave</strong></p>
					<p>This is one of the caves where once the crafty Batwa (who were warriors) lived and fought their neighbors, the Bantu. The distance to the cave entrance from the park headquaters is 3 km long</p>
